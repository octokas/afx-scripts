## Editing

_Creates a timeline of slides with markers for each slide._

### slideTimeline.jsx

To use this script:
1. Save it as `slideTimeline.jsx`
2. In After Effects, go to `File > Scripts > Run Script File`
3. Select your composition
4. Use the UI to add slides

Each slide is marked with a composition marker, and the script maintains the timing relationships between slides automatically.

You can extend this further by adding features like:
- Slide duration controls
- Transition effects between slides
- Layer management within slides
- Slide preview thumbnails
- Export/import slide arrangements
